(The issues leading to the suspension of my seller account stemmed from my previous use of) Tj
T* (product inserts and packaging stickers that incentivized customers to leave reviews in exchange) Tj
T* (for free products or rewards. This practice was initiated as a marketing strategy aimed at boosting) Tj
T* (product visibility and sales. However, I did not fully comprehend the extent to which this) Tj
T* (approach would violate Amazon's policies regarding manipulation of reviews and seller conduct.) Tj
T* (The goal was to foster positive feedback and enhance customer engagement, but it inadvertently) Tj
