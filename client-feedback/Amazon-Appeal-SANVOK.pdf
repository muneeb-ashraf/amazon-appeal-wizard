(The suspension of my seller account is primarily attributed to excessive cancellations resulting) Tj
T* (from my previous fulfillment practices, specifically through dropshipping. Initially, I adopted) Tj
T* (this model with the intention of streamlining operations and leveraging supplier connections to) Tj
T* (offer a wider range of products. However, I quickly discovered that this approach was fraught) Tj
T* (with challenges, particularly regarding supplier reliability and inventory management. Many of) Tj
T* (the suppliers I partnered with were unable to consistently fulfill orders as expected, leading to a) Tj
T* (higher-than-acceptable cancellation rate, which ultimately triggered the review of my account.) Tj

T* (thorough investigation into my order fulfillment processes and supplier performance. This) Tj
T* (examination included reviewing customer communications, analyzing order data, and assessing) Tj
T* (the reliability of the suppliers I was working with. I found that numerous orders were canceled) Tj
T* (due to stock unavailability, delayed shipments, and a lack of proper inventory synchronization) Tj
T* (between my seller account and my suppliers. These issues not only disrupted customer) Tj
