(To investigate the root causes of these complaints, we performed a comprehensive review of our) Tj

T* (customers who had raised concerns, and we analyzed our inventory records and outgoing orders.) Tj
T* (Through this process, we identified that the lapses in quality control during our packaging and) Tj
T* (fulfillment processes contributed to the missing components. We discovered that there were) Tj
T* (instances where inventory checks were not effectively carried out prior to shipment, leading to) Tj
T* (incomplete orders being dispatched to customers.) Tj
