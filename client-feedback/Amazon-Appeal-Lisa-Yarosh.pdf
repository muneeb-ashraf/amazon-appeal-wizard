(The suspension of my seller account was primarily caused by the existence of multiple accounts) Tj
T* (that were mistakenly identified as related, leading to concerns regarding policy violation. I had) Tj
T* (opened a personal Amazon seller account that I never fully utilized. This account was set up) Tj
T* (around the same time I began operating my business account under Seymour Auto Wrecking Inc.) Tj
T* (Due to my work-from-home arrangement, both accounts shared similar information, including) Tj
T* (billing addresses and possibly the same IP address, as I accessed them from the same home) Tj
T* (network. This inadvertently raised flags during Amazon’s routine monitoring processes, resulting) Tj
T* (in a connection being drawn between the two accounts.) Tj

(Upon receiving the suspension notification, I immediately conducted an extensive review of my) Tj
T* (accounts and their respective activities. I meticulously examined the account settings, listing) Tj
T* (details, and communication history. During this investigation, I discovered that my personal) Tj
T* (account had been inactive, and I had not engaged in any selling activity through it, which) Tj
T* (contributed to the confusion surrounding its association with my business account. It became) Tj
T* (evident that the lack of differentiation between the two accounts, coupled with the similar) Tj
T* (information provided, led to the misidentification of my accounts as related and subsequently) Tj
T* (flagged for potential policy violations.) Tj
