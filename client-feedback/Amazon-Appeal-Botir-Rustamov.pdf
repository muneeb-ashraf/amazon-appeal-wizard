(The suspension of our Amazon Relay account stems from allegations related to load and truck) Tj
T* (irregularities involving the vehicle under our management. Specifically, Amazon flagged issues) Tj
T* (concerning the assignment and usage of our truck, which they assert constitutes a violation of) Tj
T* (Relay program policies. While we have consistently operated with the utmost integrity, using) Tj
T* (only our own drivers and company-owned equipment, it appears that a misunderstanding has led) Tj
T* (to this situation. The primary concern revolves around the use of our truck, which Amazon) Tj
T* (claims was improperly documented or misidentified during load assignments.) Tj

(To investigate the root cause of this issue, we conducted a thorough review of our operations and) Tj
T* (documentation associated with the flagged loads. We examined all relevant records, including) Tj
T* (assignment logs, driver assignments, vehicle registrations, and proof of ownership. Our findings) Tj
T* (confirmed that the truck in question has consistently been used in compliance with Amazon's) Tj
T* (policies, and we have documentation—such as the Bill of Sale and title proving ownership—that) Tj
T* (validates our claim of rightful ownership and usage of the vehicle in question. However, despite) Tj

T* (2025, with a confirmation that the same truck \(which had been flagged previously\) was the) Tj
T* (center of concern. We believe that this accounts for a misconstrued interpretation of our) Tj
