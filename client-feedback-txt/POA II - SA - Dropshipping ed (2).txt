Dear Seller Performance,

Please forward the appeal to a manager on your team.

After submitting our previous appeal, we have only received an unrelated notification stating that our account had been verified, but the account was suspended in 2017 for a violation of the dropshipping policy, which we have addressed in this appeal as well.

We are respectfully requesting a fresh review of our case. We will close the account as soon as it is reinstated, as it is causing a related accounts link to our main business account.

Root causes of the Drop Shipping Policy violations - wrong choice of sourcing model

We received a notification stating that our seller account has been deactivated due to an inability to verify information, including our selling history and listings. We believe this deactivation is a result of our decision to dropship orders directly from our wholesaler. We take full responsibility for these violations.

We initially opened this account with the intent of selling generic products sourced from wholesale suppliers. Being new to the platform and unfamiliar with Amazon’s policies, we adopted a dropshipping model. We partnered with a supplier, Novatech Wholesale, which had the ability to connect with our account and automatically upload their products for sale.

Unfortunately, due to technical issues, the inventory and available units were not properly updated, resulting in order cancellations and refunds for unshipped items. We now understand that our actions did not comply with Amazon’s dropshipping policy, particularly by failing to list ourselves as the seller of record.

We acknowledge our mistakes in this sourcing process, and we take full responsibility for violating Amazon's dropshipping policy.



Actions taken to resolve the issue:

We have refunded all buyers who filed complaints and have ceased sourcing from Novatech Wholesale. Additionally, we are no longer engaging in dropshipping.

We are seeking reactivation of this account so that we can properly close it, as its current status has caused a related account link to our main business account, disrupting our sales.

To address the issues raised, we have thoroughly reviewed Amazon’s Business Solutions Agreement, along with its selling policies, paying particular attention to the dropshipping policy and prohibited seller activities. We now fully understand that:

We must be the seller of record for all products sold.

We must clearly identify ourselves as the seller on all packing slips and other documentation provided with products shipped to Amazon customers.

We are responsible for accepting and processing customer returns.

We must comply with all terms of the seller agreement and Amazon’s applicable policies.

We take full responsibility for violating these policies and have implemented quality control measures to improve supplier oversight and ensure compliance going forward.



Steps we have taken to prevent such cases in the future:

Drop-Shipping Quality Control:  

All packing slips, invoices and any other materials drop-shipped to Amazon’s customers shall bear our Amazon store name and identify only us as the seller of the product.

We have implemented quality control procedures to ensure all our drop-shipments comply with this program, including reviews with our suppliers and random test-buys.

The shipping and delivery of all orders shall comply with all applicable Amazon policies

We will terminate our relationship with any supplier who does not comply with the drop-shipping policy.

Inventory Quality Control:

We will spot check our suppliers to ensure that each product taken into inventory is inspected for condition, quality and functionality, is in good working order, and matches the detail page exactly.

Management will meet weekly with our quality assurance team to ascertain how to correct any inconsistencies in our supply replenishment system, to include shipping delays, and assess any changes or adjustments which may have to be made to inventory numbers in Seller Central, Handling Days, and suppliers.  

Management will meet weekly with the quality assurance team to ascertain how to correct the problem of any defective or damaged products or shipping delays, including changes or adjustments which may have to be made to suppliers.  

We have reviewed all Amazon’s policies and guidelines, and pledge to follow them to the letter as well as to keep advised of any changes to create an excellent shopping experience for your customers. Please reinstate our selling privileges.



Thank you for your consideration,

SANVOK
