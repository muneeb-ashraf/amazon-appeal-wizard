Dear Seller Performance Team,

Please assign this to a manager. Amazon is in error. Our product was obviously classified wrongly. The product is not an “Adhesive Patch” like it is stated in Amazon notifications. Our product is a Baby Nasal Aspirator -  a tube that helps to remove accumulated mucus in a painless, hygienic and effective way. It works by human powered suction, the degree of intensity can be controlled, so that it is not too uncomfortable for the baby.

We have attached all the requested documents to support the 510(K) claim exemption, but continue to receive template responses requesting documents that our product is not supposed to have due to its nature as a product intended for home use and not designed for professional medical purposes.

We desperately need you help to resolve this misunderstanding. We kindly request to assign a senior investigator from your department to study our case attentively. 



EVIDENCE THAT OUR ACCOUNT COMPLIES WITH THE AMAZON “RESTRICTED PRODUCTS” POLICY



We have thoroughly studied FDA corresponding articles multiple times to confirm our product is 510(k) exempt:

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) resources-- "How to Determine if Your Product is a Medical Device":https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/overview/classifyyourdevice/ucm051512.htm-- "510(k) Clearances":https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/510kClearances/default.htm-- "Device Registration and Listing":https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/RegistrationandListing/default.htm-- "Who Must Register, List and Pay the Fee":https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/RegistrationandListing/ucm053165.htm

We have confirmed that there are no other restricted products in our inventory.

We have appointed an additional manager to check every future offer to make sure it’s in compliance with all policies before we upload it to our inventory.

We confirm that we can provide a proper shopping experience to Amazon’s customers in compliance with Amazon’s policies.

We have hired an attorney who has educated me on all applicable laws to determine which products are prohibited to sale on Amazon.

We confirm that we have always intended to conduct my business exclusively and strictly in accordance with the rules of Amazon.



OUR PRODUCT IS A VACUUM BABY NASAL ASPIRATOR, INTENDED FOR HOME USE, WHICH IS CLASS I MEDICAL DEVICE EXEMPT FROM PREMARKET NOTIFICATION 510(k). 



Please review our updated appeal and files attached and please reinstate the listing.



Root Causes of Policy Issues – AMAZON IS IN ERROR

Our listing for ASIN: B00J7KU3LA has been identified as a professional use only medical device, which requires 510(k) clearance for over the Counter use (OTC).

This product is NOT a professional use medical device, it is a nasal suction aspirator helping to clear baby’s nasal congestion. It is intended for home use.

Our product falls under the Sec. 880.6740 Vacuum-powered body fluid suction apparatus (21CFR880.6740): 

PART 880 -- GENERAL HOSPITAL AND PERSONAL USE DEVICES

Subpart G - General Hospital and Personal Use Miscellaneous Devices

Sec. 880.6740 Vacuum-powered body fluid suction apparatus

“(a) Identification. A vacuum-powered body fluid suction apparatus is a device used to aspirate, remove, or sample body fluids. The device is powered by an external source of vacuum. This generic type of device includes vacuum regulators, vacuum collection bottles, suction catheters and tips, connecting flexible aspirating tubes, rigid suction tips, specimen traps, noninvasive tubing, and suction regulators (with gauge).

(b) Classification. Class II (special controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to § 880.9.

[45 FR 69682, Oct. 21, 1980, as amended at 63 FR 59229, Nov. 3, 1998]”

We are providing:

photos of all sides of the product packaging, 

photos of the instructions for use included with the product

invoice for the product

AS THE PRODUCT DOES NOT REQUIRE A 510(k), THERE IS NO NEED TO PROVIDE:

The 510(k) number issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) for this product.

The device manufacturer’s FDA establishment registration number or the owner or

operator number.

The device name as it appears in the manufacturer’s device listing.

A purchase order, invoice, or letter, all must be written in English, from the

manufacturer confirming that the device was purchased from the manufacturer.

The product packaging has detailed instructions on the back of the box as shown in attached.

Based on the information above and the supporting documents we attached to our plan of action, our listing was erroneously deactivated and should be reinstated. 



Actions taken to resolve the issue

We have confirmed with our manufacturer, as well as other manufacturers of similar products, that our product is exempt from 510(k) registration. None of these manufacturers hold a 510(k) registration, as their products are classified as non-medical and are not subject to this regulatory requirement.

To ensure compliance and provide clear information, we have revised and sanitized the product description and bullet points to remove any language that could be interpreted as medical claims. Additionally, we have included high-resolution images of both the front and back of the product packaging, clearly showing that there are no terms or properties that could be considered medical claims.

We have attached the following supporting information to confirm that the product is exempt regulations:

Pictures of the product 

Instruction for the product

Invoice for the product in question

In addition to these steps, we will:

Continue monitoring the product listing to ensure all content aligns with Amazon’s policies.

Regularly review product documentation with our legal and regulatory teams to ensure continued compliance with FDA and Amazon regulations.

Implement a process to update all product listings across our catalog, ensuring that any language potentially triggering medical claims is avoided.

Educate our team on best practices for listing non-medical products to prevent similar issues in the future.

These corrective actions will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure continued adherence to regulatory standards.

We pledge never to sell a product on Amazon that is restricted.

If we are in doubt as to the listing of any potential products, we will contact Seller Support for permission to list the product.

Bubzi Co.
