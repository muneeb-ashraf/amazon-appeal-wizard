# Amazon Appeal Wizard

Minimal Next.js app scaffold (App Router) using latest Next.js.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes:
- `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` are pinned to "latest" in `package.json`. You can change to specific versions if needed.
- This scaffold uses the App Router (`app/` directory).
